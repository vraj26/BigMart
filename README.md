# BigMart
## Overview: 
Creating a ML (Machine Learning) model to predict sales of BigMart. Various methods are used such as Linear Regression,  Data Analysis, etc.

## Problem Statement
"The data scientists at Big Mart have collected sales data for one thousand five hundred and fifty-nine products across ten stores in different cities. Furthermore, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find the sales figures of each product at a particular store."

Using this model, Big Mart will try to understand the properties of products and stores, which play a key role in increasing sales.

### Factors which could affect "Sales"
The possible factors which could affect the target variable "sales":

- Time of the week
- Time of the day
- Time of the year
- Store size and location
- Item being sold

## Key Steps
1. Making a hypothesis about the data without observing it
2. Performing Data Exploration in which found some nuances in the data which required remediation
3. Performing data cleaning and feature engineering and inputed missing values as well as solved other irregularities
4. Making new features and making data model-friendly using one-hot encoding
5. Building a regression model
